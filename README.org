* Introduction

  Keep notes on Gnus articles and emails - not all of them, just the ones that matter,
  viewed with the convenience of helm. Keep more extensive notes and tasks about
  your gnus-notes with Org-mode.

  The gnus-notes works with your Gnus, it can not replace it. Neither can it damage
  or hurt your Gnus. Your Gnus is safe. It just works in the background,
  unimpending, efficiently and quietly, keeping track of the articles read with
  gnus. When an article is read, it adds a quick note. It removes notes of deleted
  articles or the ones expunged by gnus.

  Providing a good level of Gnus-Org integration. It will enhance your Gnus
  experience. Simply, that's all.

  This simplicity allows the user to add and remove articles to gnus-notes, stress
  free. Gnus-notes can be used without having to start gnus.

  Viewing gnus-notes with the powerful helm interface brings great search
  capabilities and all the other helm goodness. \\
  Gnus-notes has been built around helm.

  Gnus is not limited to email, that is why gnus uses the term "articles".
  Gnus-notes follows the Gnus general philosophy, it also uses the term "articles".
  Most testing has been done on email (and IMAP in particular) and RSS.

  This work is a fork of =unhammer='s [[https://github.com/unhammer/gnus-recent/blob/master/gnus-recent.el][gnus-recent]]. Some ideas for integration with
  other emacs features are from =ericabrahamsens='s [[http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/gnorb.html][gnorb]] package.

  This is still work in progress. But safe to use.

* Prerequisites

  The following packages are required, for =gnus-notes=:
  - =bbdb= and =bbdb-mua=
  - =gnus=
  - =org-gnus= or the newer =ol-gnus=.
  - =helm-lib=
  - =s=

* Installation

  This is not an Emacs package, so installation is still a manual process. Place
  the files in a directory and add it the load path. Load the library or using
  require:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'gnus-notes-helm)
    (gnus-notes-init)
  #+end_src

  Now your gnus-notes is waiting to start tracking your Gnus. After viewing a few
  emails or other gnus articles, to start using gnus-notes, invoke the helm
  command 'gnus-notes-helm'. This command is the main entry to gnus-notes. For
  quick access, add an option to your favorite hydra or assign to a global key:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c m") #'gnus-notes-helm)
  #+end_src

  For org integration the user has to define a key sequence. This should be set in
  the user configuration file or run manually. The convenience function
  =gnus-notes-org-define-key= can be used:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (gnus-notes-org-define-key)  ; default "C-c t"
    ;; or
    (gnus-notes-org-define-key "C-c X") ; use another key sequence
  #+end_src

  Advanced users can look at the definition of the above function, to fine-tune
  their needs.

* Usage

  After loading the =gnus-notes= library, start your =gnus= and read a few
  articles (emails). To view the list of the emails and articles just read, type
  the command =gnus-notes-helm=.

  For quick access asign to a global key, such as:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c m") #'gnus-notes-helm)
   #+end_src

  Or add it as an option to your favorite hydra.

  Gnus is very efficient in displaying new emails, but sometimes it is hard to
  remember the =Group= the rest of the thread was filed. Just =C-c m=, to fire up
  the gnus-note helm interface and quickly narrow to the thread using subject
  words or the sender's name. The filling =Group= will be shown.

** Viewing notes

   Below is a shot of =helm-gnus-notes= showing (fake) emails from the [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/gnus-mock.html][gnus-mock]]
   package (a Mock Gnus installation for testing).
   #+name: fig:helm-mocky01
   [[file:./img/readme-Mocky-01.png]]

   The helm search is performed on the whole lines. Matching and refining the search
   is part of helm:
   #+name: fig:helm-mocky02
   [[file:./img/readme-Mocky-02.png]]

   Gnus-notes displays one email (or gnus article) each line, with the following
   information:
   1. Sender or recipient, according to =gnus-ignored-from-addresses=.
   2. Subject line
   3. Date, default in Org date format, but customizable.
   4. Gnus group name.

   For other gnus article, such as =RSS= feeds instead of emails, the above info are
   displayed similarly:
   #+name: fig:helm-nrss
   [[file:./img/readme-nrss.png]]

   Helm provides many useful features. Pressing =M-<up>=, displays additional
   information, such as =To=, =Cc= fields if available, in multi-line format:
   #+name: fig:helm-mocky01
   [[file:./img/readme-Mocky-03.png]]

   Helm has many features. It is worth checking the helm manual (=C-h m=). It is
   beyond this README to provide detailed info on Helm.

** Actions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       26cf3c01-579c-487c-bcce-20c22e5da9eb
   :END:

   By default the following actions are available:
   #+name: tbl:actions-default
   #+caption: helm default actions
   |--------+----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Key    | Action                     | Remarks                                                                              |
   |--------+----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | =[F1]= | Open article               | will open the article in gnus                                                        |
   | =[F2]= | Reply (to) article         | ~Wide-reply-and-yank~ (~S W~)                                                        |
   | =[F3]= | Show thread                | ~gnus-summary-refer-thread~ (~A T~)                                                  |
   | =[F4]= | Copy org-link to kill ring | Create an org-link                                                                   |
   | =[F5]= | Insert org-link            | Insert org-link to point in buffer                                                   |
   | =[F6]= | Remove marked article(s)   | Remove current article or multiple marked articles (C-<space>) from the gnus-notes. |
   |        |                            | Gnus is not affected, this only affects the list.                                    |
   | =[F7]= | Display BBDB entries       | Display BBDB buffer.                                                                 |
   | =[F8]= | Clear all                  | Start over. Clear ALL the articles on the list. Careful!                             |
   |--------+----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

   Applying any of the actions, will close the helm buffer. You can get back by
   restarting =helm-gnus-notes= or resuming with =helm-resume= (=C-x c b=).

*** Persistent Actions

    The message at the top of the helm window is a hint to persistent actions.
    Persistent actions are special actions that do not close the helm buffer.
    : C-j: quick helm config and actions (keeping session)
    Gnus-notes provides a hydra, to select from a number of available persistent
    actions, a mix of helm configuration items and actions on the articles:

    #+name: fig:persistent-actions
    [[file:./img/readme-persistent.png]]

* Org integration

  The =C-c t= key sequence activates the =gnus-notes= integration functionalities.
  It is associated with different actions depending on the mode:
  - in =org-mode=, it lists all the =gnus:= type links under the current org subtree.
  - in =summary= or =article-mode=, i.e. while reading in gnus, lets you directly
    create a quick note using the org-capture system. It preselects the capture template. By
    default, it is set to creating a *REPLY* to-do heading. The user can customize
    this of course, this is Emacs, after all.

  This sections assumes the default key sequence is used. If the user has defined
  another, it should be used.

** Org-mode

   In a org-mode file, typing =C-c t= will scan the whole subtree under the current
   heading for org links using the =gnus:= prefix. These are =org-gnus= links, as
   defined in package =org-gnus= or =ol-gnus= (newer).

   The user is presented with a choice menu (another hydra!) on what to do:

  #+name: fig:hydra-current-heading
  [[file:img/readme-org-current-heading.png]]

  The options have the following meaning:
  - =h=: View in helm using notes. Only the articles in notes will be displayed.
  - =t=: Apply a ~Wide-reply-and-yank~ (~S W~) to top item.
  - =v=: Search Gnus using the =nnir= gnus engine. This is configured by default for
    the =nnimap= engine. For other gnus back ends, some setup is required. See the
    Gnus manual for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/Searching.html#Searching][Searching]] details.

  Here, if/when selecting the action to reply to an article display in the =h=
  option, or directly in the =t= option, the user will be offered to save a quick
  note under to the current heading. This note is created using the =org-add-note=
  (=C-c C-z=) command. It will have the following information:
  1. An org timestamp
  2. An org-gnus link to the message just sent
  3. The user supplied text notes.

  Where the note is placed depends on the variables =org-log-into-drawer=. By
  default notes are stored in the =LOGBOOK= drawer. The user may want to customize,
  to place the note outside the drawer.

** Reading in Gnus

   While reading, the mostly email, articles in gnus the user can use the familiar
   =C-c t= key sequence to directly capture an org-note using the preselected
   =gnus-notes-org-capture-key= (default "*e*" for email) org-capture template. A
   suggested capture template is provided by gnus-notes, which the user may
   customize. See =gnus-notes-org-capture-template=.

   This is a handy way for creating a "REPLY" task for responding to an email. Once
   the reply has been sent, the task can be marked "REPLIED" or "DONE", or if
   expecting an answer, marked "WAIT" along with a scheduled time until sending a
   reminder.

* Implementation details

  Most development and testing has been done using gnus IMAP, keeping the emails on
  the IMAP server.

  Gnus-notes works in the background, while the user is using gnus. It takes a note
  of each article you read. The note contains some basic information about the
  article. The first time an article is read, this note is stored in a list
  (=gnus-notes--articles-list=).

  The above process has two consequences:
  1. the article notes are saved in the sequence read by the user (you).
  2. only read article notes are on the list. Articles deleted or ignored are not on
     the list.

  This provides a natural first filtering of the articles, that helps to keep the
  size small. Gnus-notes does not try (or want) to keep track of everything.

** Saving

   Gnus-notes creates its own directory for its saving needs. This is defined in
   =gnus-notes-top-dir=, default ="~/.emacs.d/gnus-notes"= . The Gnus-notes list
   is saved in =gnus-notes-file=, default ="~/.emacs.d/gnus-notes/articles.el"=.

   To guard against data-loss, a breadcrumbs directory (for the crumbs left behind!)
   is defined in =gnus-notes-breadcrumbs-dir=, default
   ="~/.emacs.d/gnus-notes/crumbs"=. These "crumbs" will be cleaned up when
   gnus-notes starts or is saved (~gnus-notes-save~).

   These path locations can be changed using the customize interface.

** Interaction with Gnus

   Gnus-notes tries to track gnus operations, to provide an accurate status. Direct
   gnus operations will update article details in gnus-notes:
   - Moving (=B M=) an article to another group, will update the group location
   - Deleting (=B <del>=) article(s) will remove it/them from gnus-notes
   - Expunging (=G x=) will also remove article(s) from gnus-notes

   On the other hand, *operations to gnus-notes have no effect on gnus*, see
   [[id:26cf3c01-579c-487c-bcce-20c22e5da9eb][Actions]]. So, when an article is removed/deleted from gnus-notes, only the note
   is deleted from the list. The actual article(s) is still available in gnus and
   can be read back to gnus-notes.

** Limitation due to Gnus dependance

   As mentioned above, gnus-notes tracks Gnus. It does not know of any actions
   performed outside of Gnus. This means that any actions such as moving, deleting
   performed using the web-interface to your imap email, will not be reflected in
   gnus-notes. So, for example, gnus-notes may display the wrong group for an email
   that was moved using the web-interface.
